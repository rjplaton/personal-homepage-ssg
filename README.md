Working on a Django version of my personal site at [https://rjplaton-com.herokuapp.com/](https://rjplaton-com.herokuapp.com/) featuring my profile, projects & blog. It's a playgound for building and iterating on a concepts and things I've learned in programming.

### Current tech stack:
- **Django**
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Hosted on Heroku


### Instructions on updating & testing the website:
1. Django's using an MVC format
2. Add/edit view functions in views.py
3. Add/edit routes in urls.py
4. Run server via manage.py and open localhost:8000

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
```
